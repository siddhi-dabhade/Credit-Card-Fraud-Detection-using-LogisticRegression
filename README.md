# Project Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression, a widely-used statistical method for binary classification. By leveraging historical transaction data, the model predicts whether a given transaction is fraudulent or legitimate, helping financial institutions and payment processors mitigate the risk of fraud.

# Features
1.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Visualizes transaction data distributions and identifies patterns indicative of fraud.

2.Model Training: 
Implements logistic regression for binary classification, optimizing hyperparameters to enhance model performance.

3.Evaluation Metrics: 
Assesses model accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to ensure robust fraud detection.

# Dependencies
1. Python 3.x
2. NumPy
3. Pandas
4. Scikit-learn
5. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn
